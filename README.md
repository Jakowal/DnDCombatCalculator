# DnDCombatCalculator
A spare-time project to create a tool for Dungeon Masters in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

This calculator has a list of Premade monsters that can be added via a dropdown menu. 
The list currently includes monsters from A-Z in the Monster Manual.
These premade monsters also have the option to roll the attacks that can be found int the Monster Manual.
Attacks can be selected via a dropdown menu and the results will show by the top of the screen.
Different damage types are currently ignored, and only the total of the to-hit roll and damage rolls will be shown.

Furthermore, the calculator can be used to track the health and initiative of other monsters as well.
These monsters can be added through the main menu where they can be given names (Name a la Monster1 are set as default).
They must also be given a max health number, and can be given an initiative score, though this is optional.

After a Monster has been added, the only alterable statistic for it will be its health.
If the health of a monster reaches 0, it will go into death save mode where a DM can keep track of death saves if that is wanted.
